# Trie-Augmented Neural Networks (TANNs) Library

## Overview

Trie-Augmented Neural Networks (TANNs) combine trie structures with neural networks, creating a hierarchical design that enhances decision-making transparency and efficiency in machine learning. This library provides a foundational implementation of TANNs, allowing users to explore their applications in text and document classification using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs). The library supports PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow frameworks.

## Features
